These are an assortment of projects I completed in C as part of my Honors Intro to CS II course at UChicago. Working in C allowed me to explore both iterative and recursive design, as well as algorithm paradigms including greedy algorithms, divide and conquer algorithms, and dynamic programming. Files titled "theory.pdf" in most project folders include responses to theory questions on data structures like minimum heaps, binary search trees, and hash tables, as well as algorithms like Dijkstra's algorithm and Kruskal's algorithm. Parts of the code in this repository, such as function templates, were instructor-provided, but the vast majority of the logic and function implementations were written by me.
